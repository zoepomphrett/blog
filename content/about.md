My name is Zoë Pomphrett and I’m currently in my second year studying English. As you can probably tell from my favourite books pictured above, I’ll read pretty much anything, although I’m happy to admit I have a soft spot for a good romance. I’m hoping this blog will give me the chance to review new releases and share some of the memorable books I’ve encountered through my studies, as well as offering me an excuse to revisit old favourites! It's rare to find me without a cup of tea or a snack and on those few occasions I'm not reading, I can usually be found either out walking (whilst coveting other people's dogs!), singing or cooking with friends and family.
