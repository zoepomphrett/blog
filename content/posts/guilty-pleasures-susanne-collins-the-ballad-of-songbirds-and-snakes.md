Suzanne Collins - The Ballad Of Songbirds And Snakes

First reading this on a friends kindle backstage at a school dance show - not the most illustrious introduction to a series, but at a time when Hunger Games fever was raging I was quickly swept up in all the excitement

With both Suzanne Collins and Stephanie Meyer releasing new booms based on their old successful worlds, I cynically laughed at how both of those influential pre-teen (in my time any way!) authors were continuing to make money off their big literary breaks

But perhaps I’m being too harsh...today I’ll be discussing whether Collin’s new novel is of worth in its own right

And how they’re ruined by the interceding films?
