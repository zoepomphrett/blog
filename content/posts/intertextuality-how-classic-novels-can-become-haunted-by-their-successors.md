Jane Eyre and Wide Sargasso Sea

laughter and knife images - in Jane Eyre too?

Wide sargasso = very episodic, different perspectives

Ages of the characters

Time and place

Era in which the story is set

Laughter = happiness has been turned into something haunting, twisted and disturbing (links perhaps to the pride of many of the characters who are afraid to be laughed at)
