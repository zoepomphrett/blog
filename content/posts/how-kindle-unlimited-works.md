Until a friend explained to me a few weeks ago how Spotify paid their artists, I had never thought to question how Kindle Unlimited (KU) worked for authors.

Of course, it’s debated whether KU is even worth the money for readers themselves – £7.99 a month for access to a collection that includes less than half of the ebooks available on Amazon is probably not particularly attractive to someone who reads less than a book per week. However, as someone whose dad once told them they needed to spend far less money on books, it seemed to present the thrilling possibility of endless reading. In fact, as the subscription payment is taken automatically out of your bank account each month, it almost feels as though you’re getting books for free! I’ve been subscribed to KU for over five years and until now I’d never thought about cancelling my subscription. But perhaps I’ve been overhasty in my support for this system, **which**.

###### How does Kindle Unlimited work?

For readers it’s perfectly simple. After paying the subscription fee, you can borrow up to ten books at a time, for as long as you like. Once you reach ten books, you just return one of your previous loans and download a new book.

###### What happens to your subscription money?

Amazon places all the money they receive from KU subscriptions in one large pot, which is then divided between all the KU authors.

###### How does Amazon work out how much money each KU author receives?

Rather than paying royalties per borrow, as occurs following a normal purchase, Amazon pays each author a percentage of the overall pot which depends on how many individual pages of their borrowed books have been read.

###### Why is such a system so problematic? 

This means that if someone borrows a book but for some reason never reads it, that author will never receive any money. For me, this implies a totally alien shopping mindset – between my Kindle and my physical bookshelf I probably possess around a hundred books I haven’t yet read (I’m surely a perpetrator of _tsundoku_, the Japanese word for hoarding books but not reading them!). So, in some cases, Amazon are taking my subscription fee, but the author whose book I thought I’d essentially bought will see none of my money.

But even if you borrow a book on KU and finish it, the author will still receive far less money than they would have done had you bought their book outright. On average, authors are paid less than half a penny per page, so if someone has written a 200-page book, they would receive an absolute maximum of £1.00 for it, assuming it was finished, but if they had sold it outright for a slightly more than £1.00, payment wouldn’t depend on whether or not it was finished, or even started. Although some authors maintain that people buy their books after having read and enjoyed them as a KU borrow, being part of a generation that is widely unconcerned by explicit ownership, I would never have thought to have done so. In fact, the ease of KU has led to borrows being equated with samples, as you can simply return the book if it doesn’t immediately capture your attention. The pay per page system also devalues shorter books like novellas, children’s books and picture books, making it more difficult for those authors to break into the market.

Furthermore, despite the Kindle Edition Normalized Page, which supposedly accounts for different word or line spacings in different books, there is still significant scope for scamming within this system. In click farms people are paid to ‘read’ titles scammers have created, sometimes even displacing genuine authors from bestsellers lists or getting writers banned from Amazon by using their content to pad out fake books.

###### So, what should I do in light of this information?

Although many authors must support, or at least accept this system, it seems to devalue the immense effort that must go into writing a book, by preventing authors from gaining adequate monetary recognition for their work.

Low priced books – just buy them! (could double the profit made by the author?)
