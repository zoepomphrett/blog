Until a friend explained to me a few weeks ago how Spotify paid their artists, I had never thought to question how Kindle Unlimited worked for authors.

Of course, it's debated whether Kindle Unlimited is even worth the money for readers themselves - £7.99 a month for access to a collection that includes less than half of the ebooks available on Amazon is not an attractive prospect for the infrequent reader. However, as someone who always used to blow through their pocket money on just a few books, it seemed a thrilling proposition!

But perhaps I was overhasty in my enthusiasm for the scheme. Initially

some view it as a steep price to pay for a collection that includes less than half of the books available on Kindle (and none of the big names) - but for me it had always seemed a no-brainer. With multiple books always on the go and usually reading a couple of books a week, it seemed destined to pay for itself!

* Reputable editions of classics

Link to how Spotify works, how do the authors get paid/how much etc - does all the money go into a central pot or do individual authors get paid when their books are borrowed through Kindle Unlimited

Lots of blog posts about Kindle Unlimited and whether it's worth it for readers, but what about writers?

What's the Kindle Owners' Lending Library? What's Prime Reading?

FROM ANOTHER BLOG...

## 4. Kindle Unlimited is not “Prime Unlimited”

Many users confuse Kindle Unlimited with [Prime](https://ebookfriendly.com/amazon-prime-tips-facts/).

It’s because both services are offered by Amazon, and both are subscription based.

What’s more, some of the benefits offered for Prime members give also an unlimited access to digital content, naming only Prime Instant Video or Prime Music.

Most importantly, among many features [Amazon Prime includes benefits for book lovers](https://ebookfriendly.com/amazon-prime-benefits-book-lovers/):

* borrow books from Kindle Owners’ Lending Library,
* get free access to Prime Reading,
* get Kindle First ebook for free,
* Get free access to Audible Channels.

The most recognized service that comes with Prime is Kindle Owners’ Lending Library. Prime members can borrow one Kindle book per month from a catalog that’s quite similar to Kindle Unlimited.

One book per month. It’s clear that KOLL is addressed to occasional rather than avid readers. For more info, check out our [comparison of Kindle Unlimited vs. Kindle Owners’ Lending Library](https://ebookfriendly.com/kindle-owners-lending-library-vs-kindle-unlimited/).

But things change. In October 2016, Prime Reading was introduced, letting Prime members access a rotating selection of ebooks, comic books, and magazines. The access is unlimited, and you get all the most attractive items you can find in the entire Kindle Store.
