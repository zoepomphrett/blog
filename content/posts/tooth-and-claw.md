![The cover of Tooth and Claw on my Kindle in front of a fire](/uploads/img_8232.jpg)

Dragon elements - weirdness of their society, the eating really jolts you out of just picturing them as humans (vs the yarge...weird to think about other animals describing us in this way)

Occasionally clunky dialogue

Strange combination of being a bit radical/more modern than the Austen era on which the society seems to be based (passionate desire for selendra to get her second chance, both selendra and haner as radicals, Sebeth as a redeemed and powerful woman) and generally entrenched misogynist sentiment, desire for a regulation finish etc as well as a sense of classism being continued (wealth is required by all of the characters happy endings) even though gender issues have had been somewhat taken a stab at

Fun characters - evil and good ones

Funny narrator though weirdly random not very consistent - gently mocking mostly of themselves rather than the characters (weird ending line though)

Nice flip flopping between characters and places - never felt lost (well established at the beginning)

Evocative settings

Assess the title/tennyson against the book itself - not really that fitting in the end?? More about civilisation

“Pride and prejudice with dragons”

Look up Jo Walton

Sequel

Unassuming quality to Walton’s writing

Similar to the jovial narrators of the Victorian period

It is easy to be propelled along by her prose
